Hi, I'm a 22-year-old Computer Engineering student at **_Technische Hochschule Mannheim_**. I’m passionate about low-level
systems programming and love working on projects that dive deep into how computers work under the hood. Currently,
I'm developing my own little kernel, and the journey has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding.

My main interests lie in:

- Operating systems and kernel development
- Compiler construction
- Systems programming and performance optimization
- Exploring any tech idea that sparks curiosity

<br></br>

# Stack & Setup

**Languages:**

- 💻 Mainly coding in **_C++_** or **_Python_**
- 🐍 Previously used **_Java_** and **_TypeScript_**

**Tools & Environment:**

- 🪟 **Setup** — **_Windows 11_** + **_WSL2_** for a Linux-like development workflow
- 🧠 **Tools** — Primarily JetBrains tools like **_CLion_**, **_IntelliJ_**, **_WebStorm_**, and **_PyCharm_**
- ✨ **Misc** — Previously configured and used custom Neovim setup

<br></br>

# Projects

Some of my favorite personal projects include:

- 🧠 **Kernel Development** — Building a small but growing kernel to understand operating systems from the ground up
- 🛠️ **Compiler Experiments** — Playing with custom language designs and writing basic compilers
- 📦 **Miscellaneous System Tools** — Tools and utilities that improve or tinker with low-level systems

<br></br>

# Philosophy

I believe in continuous learning and always staying curious. I’m driven by the desire to understand how computers
really work, from transistors to terminals. My approach to programming and engineering is grounded in the joy of
discovery and the satisfaction of building something from the ground up.
