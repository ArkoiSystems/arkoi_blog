# What is ArkoiSystems?

ArkoiSystems is a collection of low-level software projects focused on systems programming, language implementation, and developer tooling. Each project is built from scratch to understand the fundamental principles of how software really works at the lowest levels.

From custom compilers to operating system kernels, ArkoiSystems explores the deepest layers of the software stack. This blog documents the journey, shares insights, and provides technical deep-dives into each project.

# Projects

- **Compiler** - A custom compiler implementation with focus on performance and clear diagnostics. Exploring lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.
- **Kernel** - A minimal operating system kernel built from scratch. Learning about memory management, process scheduling, system calls, and hardware interaction.
- **Pretty Diagnostics** - Beautiful, developer-friendly error messages and diagnostics. Making compiler errors actually helpful with context-aware suggestions and clear formatting.
- **Developer Tools** - Various utilities and tools to improve the development workflow, from debuggers to profilers.

# Tech Philosophy

ArkoiSystems projects follow these principles:

- **From Scratch** - Build fundamental understanding by implementing from first principles
- **Low-Level Focus** - Work close to the hardware, understand memory, CPU, and system architecture
- **Quality Diagnostics** - Great error messages are as important as great functionality
- **Open Learning** - Document the process, share knowledge, and help others learn systems programming

# This Site

Built with modern web technologies but themed like a terminal:

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Bun** - Ultra-fast JavaScript runtime
- **Tailwind CSS** - Terminal-themed utility styling
